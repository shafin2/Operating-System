Thread vs Process
--> thread is unique within process, process is unique within the system

#include<pthread.h>

--> like process have id pid_t, thread also have but always not return int id 
--> pthread_t is dataType to store id of thread (as it can be int, float, hex)
pthread_t id;
--> first of all create thread
pthread_create(&id,NULL,function,NULL);


--> function should be pointer function which also return pointer

--> also need to join thread like we did in shared memory
pthread_join(one,NULL);
